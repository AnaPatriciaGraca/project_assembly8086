# project_assembly8086

This project was build during my second year of Computer Engeneering.

Unfortunetly I wasnÂ´t able to finish it because this was supposed to be a group project. 
It consists in a calculator do make divisions (entire division and real division) and square root.

The challange was to desenvolve the algorithms tha would be able to do this operations with big numbers but just using 16 bits (maximum).
I was able to solve this with arrays, manually creating the algorithms of the division and square root.

The last part of this project was to be able to read from files and print to files.
Since we were in Computer Architecture, we received a file with 10 bit adresses that we add to read.
In front of this addresses there were the letter R or W (read and write) so we coud know if we were to read from thar address or write.

Given the number of blocks of the Cache memory, the placement algorithm (ex.: LFU ),the writing algorithm used (ex.: WA + WT) the type of cached used(ex.: 2-way associative) and the times used ( to accest the cache, write on the cache, write on the ram or copy from the ram to the cache) we add to calculate:
- the segment
- the inicial block placement
- the block placed
- and the time used for every address given to read or write from the cache or the ram (calculated before)



I really loved doing this prokect because it was very challenging, I'm only sorry I din't had a bit more time to finish it.
